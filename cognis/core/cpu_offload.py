"""Bounded worker-thread offload for CPU-bound controller work.

Context assembly, prompt projection, and exact token counting are synchronous
CPU work. Running them inline starves the event loop long enough to miss
liveness probes and lease renewals on large sessions, so the call sites hand
them to ``run_cpu_bound`` instead.

Capacity accounting is tied to the worker thread, not to the awaiting
coroutine: a cancelled awaiter stops waiting, but the slot stays taken until
the thread actually returns, so repeated cancellations can never exceed the
configured concurrency. Callers therefore pass isolated inputs (copies) and
publish results only after their own cancellation and fence checks.
